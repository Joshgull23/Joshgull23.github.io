     <h1>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the 
         core learning?
    </h1>
    <p>I have learned that I am a very work-determined person as I have started a little business with my
       two other flat-mates building apps. This is why I was pretty late this week handing everything in.
    </p>
    <p>I have changed my perspective on a lot of things as at first I had no idea about my brain and how 
        to develop it in a lot of different and quirky ways. 
    </p>
    <p> I am also way more confident now with javascript and this is all because of the core learning process
        (I believe) because, I have found ways around getting problems done and working productively mostly
        all of the time.
    </p>

    <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
    <p> I was very surprised that I have made it this far, core learning has helped me through each week
        and I know I have made huge improvements on myself. I know this because when I was studying at uni,
        I would distract myself with a lot of other things instead of doing my work but this time doing 
        foundations, I have enjoyed every second of it. Although I do wish that I had spent a bit more time 
        doing everything for sprint 5 a lot earlier instead of developing my app but I know I need to 
        improve myself even further than I have already.
    </p>
    
    <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
    <p> Mostly trying to wrap my head around concepts and how they would affect me. But as it was challenging, 
        it was also very fun too so I guess thatâ€™s a win-win?
    </p>

    <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a
        web development bootcamp course?
    </h1>
    <p>Not at all, I think it probably helped everyone doing foundations and it has been very important to
       me doing it.
    </p>

    <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
        that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h1>
    <p> I think that core learning helped me become better at coding in a way because my mentality has changed.
        I have started to do things in a different manner and have found myself having completely different
        routines to which I would normally be doing nothing.

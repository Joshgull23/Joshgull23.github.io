        <h1>A problem and what I’ve learnt from it:</h1>
        <p>I always get blocked on simple problems, they always seem to pop-up out of nowhere. 
           There are so many problems that I have got stuck on but the most annoying one so far has 
           been getting stuck on CSS in the first couple of weeks of my Foundations course at Dev 
           Academy. I tried my hardest to wrap my head around margin, padding and borders which 
           took me a very long time but how I solved this problem was pretty simple. I used google 
           and the many resources provided with my Foundations work and wrote everything down 
           (because that’s the way I learn best). This has helped me out a lot because it is so simple 
           to learn CSS but the only thing that was holding me back from learning it properly at first 
           was my arrogance. This is because I have learnt it before and I thought I knew everything 
           but in the end I decided to go out of my comfort zone and actually research everything 
           about it. I have learnt to do this for everything now because it is so easy to do and while 
           doing this, my brain is developing to focus better and ultimately provide better work.
        </p>

        <h1>Confidence with each problem solving solution:</h1>
        
        <h1>Pseudocode:</h1>
        <p>I’m very confident with pseudocode and it makes things a lot easier to understand by using a non-programming method.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Trying something:</h1>
        <p>Very confident with this one as it’s easy and I always use trial and error for almost everything.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Rubber ducky method:</h1>
        <p>I’ve done this, this week and honestly it helps so much. I’m now confident using this method.
        </p>

        <h1>Reading error messages:</h1>
        <p>This is my least confident method but I am getting way better at it and will focus on it way more now.
        </p>

        <h1>Console.logging:</h1>
        <p>I use this a lot as well, it’s very helpful when I want to know if something is working correctly.
        </p>

        <h1>Googling:</h1>
        <p>I use this every single day and it is one of the best tools ever.
        </p>

        <h1>Asking your peers for help:</h1>
        <p>Since I’m in a flat with two other web developers it is very easy to bounce ideas and ask questions from each other.
        </p>

        <h1>Asking coaches for help:</h1>
        <p>I haven’t been in a major situation where I have needed to ask coaches for help yet. But I know I definitely will once I’m at campus and I’m 
           really looking forward to it :).
        </p>

        <h1>Improving your process with reflection:</h1>
        <p>I’m very confident with this one as well.

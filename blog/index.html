    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <h2>Hello, I'm Josh and welcome to my website!</h2>
       <p>I guess I'll add a little bit about me.<br>
       I'm from New Plymouth and have lived there most of my life, although I have lived in Tauranga when I was 3 and Chile 
       for a month when I was 16.</br>
       <br> My main hobbies include coding and Inline Hockey, I started learning how to code in highschool and that's what
       inspired me to do the Dev Academy course. I started playing Inline Hockey when I was 7 and have played it ever since.
       I have represented my country twice in 2013 and 2016. In 2013 I played in the Junior Olympics and World Championships
       in Los Angeles for the Under 14 New Zealand Team which was amazing and in 2016 I played the same two tournaments in Hawaii
       for the Under 18 New Zealand Team.</br>
       <br></br>
       I now live in Wellington with 5 other flatmates in Newtown and I am looking forward to doing the Dev Academy course
       and then eventually gaining a job in the tech-industry.

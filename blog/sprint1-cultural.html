    <h1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
        the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took:</h1>
    <p>There was a situation where I was an assistant captain of the Under 14 New Zealand Team for Inline Hockey over in Los Angeles
       One of my teammates was struggling to create chemistry with any of the players he was on a line with and the coach wasn’t happy with his performance.
       So she eventually sat him out and replaced him with me which meant I was playing twice as much but he wasn’t playing at all.
       This didn’t seem right and he was visibly upset, which made me feel twice as bad but it wasn’t my original decision.
        This tested my morals/ethics a lot so I proposed that he entered a different line and swap a couple of players over on to his.
         As soon as this happened, he scored the most spectacular goal I’ve ever seen and his line did very well (as did the other lines).
         The moral that I gained/learned during this is that we shouldn’t put others down on performance, make a couple of shifts, make them feel comfortable and welcome and see the changes straight away. 
    </p>
    
    <h1>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity:</h1>
    <p> My culture has mostly been defined by what my parent’s/grandparent’s and friends have taught me since I was young. 
        My parent’s have been the biggest influencers for the values I now have and I thank them very much for bringing me up to be a generous and kind person.
         My core values that I believe that I possess are that I’m kind, loving, honest, dependable, courageous, curious, hard-working, humorous, positive, sporty and passionate. 
         These values I have mostly learnt from family and also finding them myself or through how my friends act and that pretty much sums up my identity.
    </p> 
    
    <h1>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:</h1>
    <p>My strengths definitely outweigh my limitations in terms of my learning and career development but obviously no-one is perfect and there are some things
        I need to work on to improve myself and how I work in these situations. My strengths in this field are being pretty efficient with my time,
        I like to get my work done to the highest standard possible given the time-frame, being passionate about the things I do and learning and processing information
        very quickly. My limitations however are critiquing my own work in a way that is helpful and constructive and spending too much time changing small aspects
        of what I’m doing before I’m finished.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles:</h1>
    <p>My strengths that might help me through my learning journey will be the same ones listed above but some of them can definitely intersect
       with my learning obstacles. Getting my work done to the highest standard possible given the time-frame is a good example because on one-hand
       it is a very good strength to have if you want your work looking nice and presentable but also it can interfere with obstacles very easily because
       it does take more time making your work look good which can screw up my time efficiency and can ultimately make things a lot more stressful and non-consistent.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
        Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why:
    </h1>
    <p>I was in my computer science group at high school and I had all of my work done on my side but the other two people were very lazy and had nothing done which
       made things very hard for me as I was going for a good grade. So I made the effort of helping them through what they needed to do and gave them ideas for them
       to figure out and we ended up making a lot of progress on our project and ended up getting an excellence. Helping them out was very effective because they were
       both stuck and they had no idea what to do, so I showed them step-by-step how to do it and they ended up learning from me. If I was in that situation again
       I’d try and verbally let them know how to do something instead of actually doing it for them so that they could do it for themselves. I’d do this because
       then they could be more proud of what they had done and they could say it was genuinely from them too.

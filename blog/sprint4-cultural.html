        <h1>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h1>
        <p>Neuroplasticity benefits people in a wicked way, Neuroplasticity makes your brain focused and helps you learn bigger things that require a 
           lot of information and brain power,like me playing Inline hockey and remembering where to be in certain situations and training my brain to be the best
           it can so my timing and power is accurate. Neuroplasticity also helps people recover from injuries or even addictions.
        </p>

        <h1>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h1>
        <p>I’m going to try and better myself with my hockey and coding because I believe that they are almost like learning a language in a way. I can train 
           my brain to become more quick and more focused on what I need to do.
        </p>

        <h1>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h1>
        <p>Keep practicing and practicing every day so that the cells in have a long-term relationship with my brain and ultimately making things second nature 
           to me and in the process making me more smart and more interested in what I’m doing.
        </p>

        <h1>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h1>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change by forming new parts and making other parts in your brain stronger.
           It is relevant to everyone because it can help in pretty much any situation like injury, addiction and even wanting to 
           better yourself.
        </p>

        <h1>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h1>
        <p>I made the conscious effort to focus and practice on exercises for longer to try better my understanding of what I was doing and it helped immensely.
           It does take time but in the future it will be very beneficial for me as it has already changed my perspective of thinking.
        </p>

        <h1>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h1>
        <p>Practice practice practice. That’s all I can really say. It is the most important thing to train your brain in the right way and I believe it will
           be through practice.
        </p>

        <h1>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h1>
        <p>These understanding will influence my learning plan/strategy in the best way possible. Knowing this information and learning about it has been 
           really awesome and as I said above, practice is going to play a big part in it.

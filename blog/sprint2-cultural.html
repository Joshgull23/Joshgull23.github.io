    <h1>A description of your own strengths and limitations:</h1>
    <p>My strengths include being time efficient, getting feedback from flatmates on how things look, trying to get the best possible outcome from the time given
       and being able to take criticism well. My limitations are that I do tend to spend a little bit of time on the minor things like for example colour and spacing
       on my website, can’t properly criticise myself in a good way and can get distracted by my flatmates at times.
    </p>

    <h1>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
        This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
        facilitators and industry/community representatives:
    </h1>
    <p>I’m very good at managing my workload but I do tend to do it quite differently to others, 
       so I guess a way I could manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners would be to see how they manage their time and maybe come
       to a middle-ground to get the product we want. With facilitators and industry/community representatives I can manage my workload by asking them good
       questions that I need answered at times of struggle and can also approach them for constructive criticism so that I can make the best possible outcome
       possible.
    </p>

    <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h1>
    <p>Not spending heaps of time trying to work one little thing out and reaching out to a workmate or facilitator to help me out so that I’m not taking
       up too much time on something minor and something that could be fixed very quickly just by asking. 
    </p>

    <h1>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h1>
    <p> If I do ever need any help or feedback I’d like them to be brutally honest and/or offer suggestions that could make whatever I’m doing even better.
         I’d just like for them to be there when I need them :).
    </p>

    <h1>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example,
        you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in:
    </h1>
    <p>I don’t have too many commitments outside of Dev Academy work apart from Inline Hockey practice on a Tuesday and Thursday. 
       So what I’ve been doing lately is waking up earlier on these days to be more productive in the day time so that I can go to trainings without feeling guilty.

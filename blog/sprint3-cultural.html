      <h1>My Understanding Of Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <p>Being self aware, knowing your own emotions, being able to express yourself properly and know what your’e actually feeling.
         I feel like emotional intelligence is greater than IQ purely because with EQ, you’re able to know and find yourself mentally
         and emotionally, you can pretty much set your mind to do anything you want it to do. Whereas with IQ, you could have a very high
         IQ and be very intelligent/book-smart but if your EQ is out of order, you can become mentally unstable, your emotions may not be
         in order and not being able to focus on what your’e doing at that time. My understanding of it is, that you can change your emotional
         intelligence through meditation and other awesome sources for the better but with IQ, it is very hard to change and with EQ I feel like 
         you have more common sense and can figure out problems easier.<br></br>

          I honestly think emotional intelligence is a very awesome attribute to attain and keep on top of because not only does it help you
          physically, but it can also help with a lot of other things in your life and balance everything out nicely. Doing the task for listening
          and looping this week was very good for me as I found out some of my own problems by just expressing them verbally. I also found it 
          very good to listen to someone else as their experiences were very different to mine and they solved things in a different way which 
          helped me to try out something different to see of I have different results from what I was originally doing.<br></br>
          
          I found that exercise is a good way to keep your EQ in-tact because you’re doing something that’s benefiting your body but also 
          benefiting your mind at the same time. I found it very interesting learning about this and I could be completely wrong with my 
          understanding of EQ but I think it doesn’t matter too much as I think what I have done this week has benefited me in a very good 
          way and I seem a lot more focussed and engaged with what I’m doing.

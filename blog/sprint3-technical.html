        <h1>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:</h1>
        <p>HTML is like a base of a new house (walls, ceiling, etc..) and CSS is like the styling of the house like lights, tv, posters, etc..
        </p>

        <h1>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 
            'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h1>
        <p>Control flow and loops are like the butterfly effect, if ‘this’ happens then ‘that’ will be the outcome.
           So I guess you could describe it simply as your decisions, then the actions it will take if you make that particular decision. 
        </p>

        <h1>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h1>
        <p>The DOM is not a language like HTML, CSS or JavaScript. However if we didn’t have it, 
           JavaScript wouldn’t be able to interact with HTML or CSS documents. The DOM represents the same HTML document as the webpage
           and then lets you add/manipulate it. An example you might interact with the DOM is using Developer Tools, 
           like Chrome DevTools. This lets you manipulate a website and change anything within it without actually doing anything
           to the original website itself.</p>
        
        <h1>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h1>
        <p>Arrays are mostly numerical and is almost like an ol (ordered list) where as objects are mostly for string which is using 
           variables that are words like (receipts) for example. The best example that I came across while studying is that while 
           they’re both very similar, you use them in different ways for example when you want to access the first item in an array 
           you use [0] (because the computer starts counting from 0) but with objects you can just access anything in the object by using 
           string like [“receipts”].
        </p>

        <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h1>
        <p>Functions are bunch of statements the perform a particular task that ultimately prints out a value. 
           It has been described as a ‘recipe’ and they are very useful for multiple reasons. You can use them for almost anything 
           and by adding parenthesis, they become extremely useful because then the user will be able to control what the outcome of the 
           function will be. They are also very useful because you can use them multiple times for multiple purposes throughout your code
           to finally come up with a result that the user can use for something like a calculator.
